### Data Science Portfolio by Jeremy Michael
UW-Madison BS. Mechanical Engineering and Data Science '23 |  MIT Sloan MBAn Candidate '24

This portfolio is a compilation of jupyter notebooks which I created to explore my interests, apply various data science techniques, and explore the use of machine learning across different datasets    

## Projects
### Bus Transit in Madison Wisconsin  
I worked with Professor Tyler Caraza-Harter and a team of two graduate students to improve Madisonâ€™s bus system. The goal of this project was to identify areas in Madison that are not well-served by the bus system and also identify redundant bus routes. A final report can be found [here](https://github.com/wisc-bus). The project can be found here.
