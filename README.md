### Data Science Portfolio by Jeremy Michael
UW-Madison BS. Mechanical Engineering and Data Science '23 |  MIT Sloan MBAn Candidate '24

This portfolio is a compilation of jupyter notebooks which I created to explore my interests, apply various data science techniques, and explore the use of machine learning across different datasets    

## Projects
### Bus Transit in Madison Wisconsin  
I worked with Professor Tyler Caraza-Harter and a team of two graduate students to improve Madison’s bus system. The goal of this project was to identify areas in Madison that are not well-served by the bus system and also identify redundant bus routes. The project attemps to offer specific suggestions that would make Madison’s bus system more reliable and efficient, ultimately better meeting the transportation needs of the community and decreasing their reliance on personal vehicles. The project can be found here.
