### Data Science Portfolio by Jeremy Michael
UW-Madison BS. Mechanical Engineering and Data Science '23 |  MIT Sloan MBAn Candidate '24

This portfolio is a compilation of jupyter notebooks which I created to explore my interests, apply various data science techniques, and explore the use of machine learning across different datasets    

## Projects
### Bus Transit in Madison Wisconsin  
I worked with Professor Tyler Caraza-Harter and a team of two graduate students to improve Madison’s bus system. The goal of this project was to identify areas in Madison that are not well-served by the bus system and also identify redundant bus routes. The code and the simulator can be found [here](https://github.com/wisc-bus). The project report can be found [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmsusanto/Bus-Transit-Project/blob/master/Final%20Report.html).
